![Project Logo](https://github.com/SBJ2000/Optimal-Delivery-Coordination-Using-Multi-Agent-Systems/blob/main/Images/Logo.jpg)

 This repository contains a multi-agent delivery system simulation, developed as part of a IAD project by Selim Ben Jeddi. The application demonstrates the interaction and cooperation of Client, Delivery, and Coordinator agents to optimize the delivery of parcels to various clients efficiently. The system utilizes concepts of distributed problem-solving, agent communication, and coordination in a dynamic environment using the JADE framework.
